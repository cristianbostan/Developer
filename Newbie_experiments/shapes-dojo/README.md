# Intro Code Dojo for Shapes

You have been provided with the tests for some empty classes.
You task is to make all the tests be green.

Please use Git to commit and push frequently, preferably after you make a change.

# What to use
* You can use anything you see fit to be able to run the tests but I recommend
installing [Intellij Community Edition (Free)](http:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* For running the tests you will need to install the JUnit 4 package.
